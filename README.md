# grabFood_assessment

This assessment is to fetch the the longitude and latitude of resturants on a search page on GrabFood.com 
For this assessment, I used [Cypress](https://cypress.io) because there is a function (cy.intercept) that can easily be used to intercept API calls during a test.

Find the extracted data [here](https://github.com/odetolataiwo/grabFood_assessment/blob/main/cypress/fixtures/testdata.json).
Also, a video that shows my cmplete run is shown [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FpaG8AsYZO4Sp0OV6XH7GHTckRkfEijc/view?usp=sharing).
