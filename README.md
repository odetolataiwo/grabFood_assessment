# grabFood_assessment

For this assessment, I used [Cypress](https://cypress.io) because there is a function (cy.intercept) that can easily be used to intercept API calls during a test.

Find the extracted data [here](https://github.com/odetolataiwo/grabFood_assessment/blob/main/cypress/fixtures/testdata.json).
Also, a video that shows my cmplete run is shown [here]().
