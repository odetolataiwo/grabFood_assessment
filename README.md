# grabFood_assessment

This assessment is to fetch the the longitude and latitude of resturants on a search page on GrabFood.com 
For this assessment, I used [Cypress](https://cypress.io) because there is a function (cy.intercept) that can easily be used to intercept API calls during a test.

To run the code, 
- clone the repo
- run `npm install`
- run `npx cypress open`
- click the assignment.spec.js file to run the process again
- the path of the exported json file is `cypress/fixtures/results.json`
- 

Find the extracted data [here](https://github.com/odetolataiwo/grabFood_assessment/blob/main/restuarants.json).
Also, a video that shows my cmplete run is shown [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FpaG8AsYZO4Sp0OV6XH7GHTckRkfEijc/view?usp=sharing).
